title: Securing NGINX-ingress
description: 'cert-manager tutorials: Using ingress-nginx to solve an ACME HTTP-01 challenge'
---

This tutorial will detail how to install and secure ingress to your cluster
using NGINX.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following: 

1. A running Kubernetes Cluster
    - You can use any Kubernetes setup, such as a managed service (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE) or a local cluster (e.g., Minikube, MicroK8s).
    - Ensure the cluster is functional and accessible using `kubectl.`
  
3. Kubectl installed and configured
    - The `kubectl` CLI should be installed and set up to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
    - Verify connectivity using:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    You should see a list of nodes in your cluster.
   
3. A domain name
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to expose your service using an Ingress resource, which typically requires a domain name to route traffic to your service.

    - For production environments: You will need to have a domain name that you can map to your Ingress resources (e.g.,`www.cert-manager.io`),    
ensuring that external traffic can reach your service securely.

    - For this tutorial: We’ll use a placeholder domain, such as `example.com,` to simplify the setup. You can replace it with your own domain name in a real-world scenario

## Step 1 - Install Helm

> *Skip this section if you have helm installed.*

The easiest way to install `cert-manager` is to use [`Helm`](https://helm.sh), a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies resource deployment.

To install Helm, follow the [official Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) or use one of the quick installation commands below.

For example, on MacOS:

```bash
brew install kubernetes-helm
```
After installing, verify that Helm is accessible:

```bash
helm version
```
if you're new to Helm, consult the official documentation for additional details.

## Step 2 - Deploy an Example Web Service

To demonstrate how to secure your services with ingress and cert-manager, we will deploy a simple NGINX web server. This server initially responds to HTTP requests with "hello world!" and will later be configured to handle HTTPS traffic securely using TLS certificates from cert-manager.

Before applying the manifest, ensure you understand its components. The deployment defines a pod running the web server, while the service exposes it within the cluster.

### Deployment Manifest

The following manifest deploys the web server:

```yaml file=./example/hello-app-deployment.yaml
```

### Apply the Deployment
Use the following command to deploy the web server:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
This command will create the deployment resource for the web server. After running it, verify that the pod is running successfully by executing:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Once the web server is running, we need to expose it within the cluster. The service resource ensures that the server can be accessed on a stable network endpoint within the Kubernetes environment.

```yaml file=./example/hello-app-service.yaml
```
### Apply the Service
Use the command to deploy the service:
```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
Once the service deployment is successful, you can check that the service has been created and is exposing the web server correctly by running:
```bash
kubectl get svc hello-app
```
This command will display information about the service, including the assigned ClusterIP and port, confirming that the service is ready to route traffic to the web server pod.

You can create, download and reference these files locally, or you can
reference them from the GitHub source repository for this documentation.
To install the example service from the tutorial files straight from GitHub, do
the following:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/hello-app-deployment.yaml
# expected output: deployment.extensions "hello-app" created

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/hello-app-service.yaml
# expected output: service "hello-app" created
```

So far, we’ve deployed a web server and ensured it is accessible within the Kubernetes cluster through a service. However, to make the application accessible from outside the cluster, we need to expose it using an Ingress resource.
The Ingress acts as a gateway that manages external HTTP and HTTPS traffic and directs it to the appropriate services within your cluster.
To use an Ingress, we need an Ingress Controller. This tutorial will guide you through deploying the NGINX Ingress Controller and configuring an Ingress resource to expose your service.


## Step 3 - Deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller and Ingress Resource

To expose the hello-app externally, we need an Ingress Controller and an Ingress resource.

A [`kubernetes Ingress Controller`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress) acts as an access point for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, directing it to the services running within your Kubernetes cluster. In this tutorial, we’ll use the NGINX Ingress Controller to manage traffic routing. This controller is deployed as a Kubernetes service, handling HTTP(S) requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend services.

You can learn more about `NGINX Ingress` from the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/).

### 3a Install the Nginx Ingress Controller

First, add the Helm repository for the NGINX Ingress Controller:
```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
```

Update the helm repository with the latest charts:
```bash
$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "ingress-nginx" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```
Install the NGINX Ingress controller using Helm:

```bash
$ helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx

NAME: nginx-ingress
... lots of output ...
```

Once the NGINX Ingress Controller is deployed, it can take a minute or two for the cluster to configure the service and provide an external IP address (if using a cloud provider's LoadBalancer). For on-premise or local Kubernetes environments like MicroK8s, you will need to check the ClusterIP or manually expose the service.

You can verify the status of the ingress controller service with the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl get svc
```
This will output a table similar to the following:
```bash
NAME                                               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
hello-app                                          ClusterIP      10.152.183.154   <none>           80/TCP                       30m
kubernetes                                         ClusterIP      10.152.183.1     <none>           443/TCP                      60m
nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.152.183.166   <pending>        80:32482/TCP,443:32483/TCP   14m
nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.152.183.240   <none>           443/TCP                      14m
```

This command shows you all the services in your cluster (in the `default`
namespace), and any external IP addresses they have. When you first create the
controller, your cloud provider won't have assigned and allocated an IP address
through the `LoadBalancer` yet. Until it does, the external IP address for the
service will be listed as `<pending>`.

Your cloud provider may have options for reserving an IP address prior to
creating the ingress controller and using that IP address rather than assigning
an IP address from a pool. Read through the documentation from your cloud
provider on how to arrange that.

### 3b Configure an Ingress Resource for the hello-app
With the Ingress Controller in place, we can create an Ingress resource to expose the hello-app externally. In this step, you will modify the example manifest to reflect the domain you own or control. This will ensure that your service is accessible from the outside world.

Here’s an example Ingress manifest you can use as a starting point:

```yaml file=./example/hello-app-ingress.yaml
```
You can download the sample manifest from GitHub , edit it, and submit the manifest to Kubernetes with the command below. Edit the file in your editor, and once it is saved:

```bash
kubectl create --edit -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/hello-app-ingress.yaml
# expected output: ingress.networking.k8s.io/hello-app-ingress created
```

> Note: The ingress example we show above has a `host` definition within it. The
> `ingress-nginx-controller` will route traffic when the hostname requested
> matches the definition in the ingress. You *can* deploy an ingress without a
> `host` definition in the rule, but that pattern isn't usable with a TLS
> certificate, which expects a fully qualified domain name.

Once it is deployed, you can use the command `kubectl get ingress` to see the status
 of the ingress:

```text
NAME                CLASS   HOSTS                 ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
hello-app-ingress   nginx   example.example.com                    80      20s
```

It may take a few minutes, depending on your service provider, for the ingress
to be fully created. When it has been created and linked into place, the
ingress will show an address as well:

```text
NAME                CLASS   HOSTS                 ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
hello-app-ingress   nginx   example.example.com   192.168.64.100   80      20s
```

> Note: The IP address on the ingress *may not* match the IP address that the
> `ingress-nginx-controller` has. This is fine, and is a quirk/implementation detail
> of the service provider hosting your Kubernetes cluster. Since we are using
> the `ingress-nginx-controller` instead of any cloud-provider specific ingress
> backend, use the IP address that was defined and allocated for the
> `nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller ` `LoadBalancer` resource as the primary  access point for
> your service.

Make sure the service is reachable at the domain name you added above, for
example `http://example.example.com`. The simplest way is to open a browser
and enter the name that you set up in DNS, and for which we just added the
ingress.

You can also use a command line tool like curl to check the status of your ingress. Here’s how you can do it:
```bash
$ curl -kivL -H 'Host: www.example.com' 'http://192.168.64.100'
```
The options in this curl command will:
    - Provide verbose output (-v), so you can see detailed request and response headers.
    - Follow redirects (-L) if necessary.
    - Display TLS headers (-i) and not error on insecure certificates (-k).
    
If the ingress is functioning correctly, you should see a response similar to this:
```bash
*   Trying 192.168.64.100:80...
* Connected to 192.168.64.100 (192.168.64.100) port 80
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.example.com
> User-Agent: curl/8.5.0
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: hello-app-5fdb69cd94-lxtv4
* Connection #0 to host 192.168.64.100 left intact
```
## Step 4 - Assign a DNS name

The external IP allocated to the ingress controller is where all incoming traffic should be routed. To make this work, you'll need to add this IP address to a DNS zone that you control. For example, you could map it to a domain like example.example.com.

This tutorial assumes you're familiar with assigning a DNS entry to an IP address. If you're unsure, you can check the documentation provided by your DNS hosting provider for more detailed instructions on how to set up the DNS record.

Once your DNS setup is complete, you can move on to securing your services with SSL/TLS certificates.

## Step 5 - Deploy cert-manager

We need to install cert-manager to do the work with Kubernetes to request a
certificate and respond to the challenge to validate it. We can use Helm or
plain Kubernetes manifests to install cert-manager.

Since we installed Helm earlier, we'll assume you want to use Helm; follow the
[Helm guide](../../installation/helm.md). For other methods, read the
[installation documentation](../../installation/README.md) for cert-manager.

cert-manager mainly uses two different custom Kubernetes resources - known as
[`CRDs`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) -
to configure and control how it operates, as well as to store state. These
resources are Issuers and Certificates.

### Issuers

An Issuer defines _how_ cert-manager will request TLS certificates. Issuers are
specific to a single namespace in Kubernetes, but there's also a `ClusterIssuer`
which is meant to be a cluster-wide version.

Take care to ensure that your Issuers are created in the same namespace as the
certificates you want to create. You might need to add `-n my-namespace` to your
`kubectl create` commands.

Your other option is to replace your `Issuers` with `ClusterIssuers`;
`ClusterIssuer` resources apply across all Ingress resources in your cluster.
If using a `ClusterIssuer`, remember to update the Ingress annotation `cert-manager.io/issuer` to
`cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer`.

If you see issues with issuers, follow the [Troubleshooting Issuing ACME Certificates](../../troubleshooting/acme.md) guide.

More information on the differences between `Issuers` and `ClusterIssuers` - including
when you might choose to use each can be found on [Issuer concepts](../../concepts/issuer.md#namespaces).

### Certificates

Certificates resources allow you to specify the details of the certificate you
want to request. They reference an issuer to define _how_ they'll be issued.

For more information, see [Certificate concepts](../../usage/certificate.md).

## Step 6 - Configure a Let's Encrypt Issuer

We'll set up two issuers for Let's Encrypt in this example: staging and production.

The Let's Encrypt production issuer has [very strict rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).
When you're experimenting and learning, it can be very easy to hit those limits. Because of that risk,
we'll start with the Let's Encrypt staging issuer, and once we're happy that it's working
we'll switch to the production issuer.

Note that you'll see a warning about untrusted certificates from the staging issuer, but that's totally expected.

Create this definition locally and update the email address to your own. This
email is required by Let's Encrypt and used to notify you of certificate
expiration and updates.

```yaml file=./example/staging-issuer.yaml
```

Once edited, apply the custom resource:

```bash
kubectl create --edit -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/staging-issuer.yaml
# expected output: issuer.cert-manager.io "letsencrypt-staging" created
```

Also create a production issuer and deploy it. As with the staging issuer, you
will need to update this example and add in your own email address.

```yaml file=./example/production-issuer.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl create --edit -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/production-issuer.yaml
# expected output: issuer.cert-manager.io "letsencrypt-prod" created
```

Both of these issuers are configured to use the [`HTTP01`](../../configuration/acme/http01/README.md) challenge provider.

Check on the status of the issuer after you create it:

```bash
$ kubectl describe issuer letsencrypt-staging
Name:         letsencrypt-staging
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={"apiVersion":"cert-manager.io/v1","kind":"Issuer","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"letsencrypt-staging","namespace":"default"},(...)}
API Version:  cert-manager.io/v1
Kind:         Issuer

    Last Transition Time:  2018-11-17T18:04:00Z
    Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
    Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:                    <none>
```

You should see the issuer listed with a registered account.

## Step 7 - Deploy a TLS Ingress Resource

With all the prerequisite configuration in place, we can now do the pieces to
request the TLS certificate. There are two primary ways to do this: using
annotations on the ingress with [`ingress-shim`](../../usage/ingress.md) or
directly creating a certificate resource.

In this example, we will add annotations to the ingress, and take advantage
of ingress-shim to have it create the certificate resource on our behalf.
After creating a certificate, the cert-manager will update or create a ingress
resource and use that to validate the domain. Once verified and issued,
cert-manager will create or update the secret defined in the certificate.

> Note: The secret that is used in the ingress should match the secret defined
> in the certificate.  There isn't any explicit checking, so a typo will result
> in the `ingress-nginx-controller` falling back to its self-signed certificate.
> In our example, we are using annotations on the ingress (and ingress-shim)
> which will create the correct secrets on your behalf.

Edit the ingress add the annotations that were commented out in our earlier
example:

```yaml file=./example/ingress-tls.yaml
```

and apply it:

```bash
kubectl create --edit -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/ingress-tls.yaml
# expected output: ingress.networking.k8s.io/kuard configured
```

Cert-manager will read these annotations and use them to create a certificate,
which you can request and see:

```bash
$ kubectl get certificate
NAME                     READY   SECRET                   AGE
quickstart-example-tls   True    quickstart-example-tls   16m
```

cert-manager reflects the state of the process for every request in the
certificate object. You can view this information using the
`kubectl describe` command:

```bash
$ kubectl describe certificate quickstart-example-tls
Name:         quickstart-example-tls
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

```

The events associated with this resource and listed at the bottom
of the `describe` results show the state of the request. In the above
example the certificate was validated and issued within a couple of minutes.

Once complete, cert-manager will have created a secret with the details of
the certificate based on the secret used in the ingress resource. You can
use the describe command as well to see some details:

```bash
$ kubectl describe secret quickstart-example-tls
Name:         quickstart-example-tls
Namespace:    default
Labels:       cert-manager.io/certificate-name=quickstart-example-tls
Annotations:  cert-manager.io/alt-names=www.example.com
              cert-manager.io/common-name=www.example.com
              cert-manager.io/issuer-kind=Issuer
              cert-manager.io/issuer-name=letsencrypt-staging

Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

Data
====
tls.crt:  3566 bytes
tls.key:  1675 bytes
```

Now that we have confidence that everything is configured correctly, you
can update the annotations in the ingress to specify the production issuer:

```yaml file=./example/ingress-tls-final.yaml
```

```bash
$ kubectl create --edit -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/acme/example/ingress-tls-final.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io/kuard configured
```

You will also need to delete the existing secret, which cert-manager is watching
and will cause it to reprocess the request with the updated issuer.

```bash
$ kubectl delete secret quickstart-example-tls
secret "quickstart-example-tls" deleted
```

This will start the process to get a new certificate, and using describe
you can see the status. Once the production certificate has been updated,
you should see the example KUARD running at your domain with a signed TLS
certificate.

```bash
$ kubectl describe certificate quickstart-example-tls

You can see the current state of the ACME Order by running `kubectl describe`
on the Order resource that cert-manager has created for your Certificate:

```bash
$ kubectl describe order quickstart-example-tls-889745041
...
Events:
  Type    Reason      Age   From          Message
  ----    ------      ----  ----          -------
  Normal  Created     90s   cert-manager  Created Challenge resource "quickstart-example-tls-889745041-0" for domain "www.example.com"
```

Here, we can see that cert-manager has created 1 'Challenge' resource to fulfill
the Order. You can dig into the state of the current ACME challenge by running
`kubectl describe` on the automatically created Challenge resource:

```bash
$ kubectl describe challenge quickstart-example-tls-889745041-0
...
Status:
  Presented:   true
  Processing:  true
  Reason:      Waiting for http-01 challenge propagation
  State:       pending
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From          Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----          -------
  Normal  Started    15s   cert-manager  Challenge scheduled for processing
  Normal  Presented  14s   cert-manager  Presented challenge using http-01 challenge mechanism
```

From above, we can see that the challenge has been 'presented' and cert-manager
is waiting for the challenge record to propagate to the ingress controller.
You should keep an eye out for new events on the challenge resource, as a
'success' event should be printed after a minute or so (depending on how fast
your ingress controller is at updating rules):

```bash
$ kubectl describe challenge quickstart-example-tls-889745041-0
...
Status:
  Presented:   false
  Processing:  false
  Reason:      Successfully authorized domain
  State:       valid
Events:
  Type    Reason          Age   From          Message
  ----    ------          ----  ----          -------
  Normal  Started         71s   cert-manager  Challenge scheduled for processing
  Normal  Presented       70s   cert-manager  Presented challenge using http-01 challenge mechanism
  Normal  DomainVerified  2s    cert-manager  Domain "www.example.com" verified with "http-01" validation
```

> Note: If your challenges are not becoming 'valid' and remain in the 'pending'
> state (or enter into a 'failed' state), it is likely there is some kind of
> configuration error. Read the [Challenge resource reference
> docs](../../reference/api-docs.md#acme.cert-manager.io/v1.Challenge) for more

Once the challenge(s) have been completed, their corresponding challenge
resources will be *deleted*, and the 'Order' will be updated to reflect the
new state of the Order:

```bash
$ kubectl describe order quickstart-example-tls-889745041
...
Events:
  Type    Reason      Age   From          Message
  ----    ------      ----  ----          -------
  Normal  Created     90s   cert-manager  Created Challenge resource "quickstart-example-tls-889745041-0" for domain "www.example.com"
  Normal  OrderValid  16s   cert-manager  Order completed successfully
```

Finally, the 'Certificate' resource will be updated to reflect the state of the
issuance process. If all is well, you should be able to 'describe' the Certificate
and see something like the below:

```bash
$ kubectl describe certificate quickstart-example-tls
Status:
  Conditions:

    Message:               Certificate is up to date and has not expired

    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
